In shell we can create posts by importing the model-> from blog.models import Post
To create a post-> Post.objects.create(author='admin', title='Blog 1', content='First Post Content')
To get all posts-> Post.objects.all()
To get a specific post-> Post.objects.get(id=1)
To get all posts by a specific user-> Post.objects.filter(author='admin')
To order the posts by title in reverse order-> Post.objects.order_by('-title')
To save a post-> post.save()
To see all users-> User.objects.all()
where User is imported from django.contrib.auth.models

Django has a special command for shell to see all the posts made by the user byu using-> user.post_set.all()
To create a post related to the same author we can use-> user.post_set.create(title='Blog 3', content='Third Post Content') and it will create the post and the post will be saved without using the post.save() command
